# this config file is a copy of the base one, tweaked for unreal on linux

# ------- General config

# Yeah the config is embedded. i donÂ´t want to have to parse an extra file everytime this client is run.
# also json has to be parsed from string, from python, while a .py not only gets precompiled, but also parsed by python itself.
# after all it's meant to run stuff that are already too heavy for one machine.
# if you need different config copy the client+config+utils+worker files elsewhere. it's very small.

# times are in seconds
