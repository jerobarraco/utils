# UnrealEngine5

This is some sample configuration to use with UnrealEngine5 and projects using ue5.
This has been tested and working under Linux.
Will quite potentially work on mac.
Will probably need a bit of work for windows.

Some files which are not modified are not in this folder (e.g. client.py worker.py utils.py and the start and connect scripts)
