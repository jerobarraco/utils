# Worker config
remapCmds: deprecated
remap only the command. it only remaps the ending part. and last ocurrence. wonÂ´t remap a folder

remapDirs: deprecated
remap the current working directory. it only remaps the starting part. so to change something in the middle. youd need to specify the whole path until there.
