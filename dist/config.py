# ------- General config

# Yeah, the config is embedded. i donÂ´t want to have to parse an extra file everytime this client is run.
# also json has to be parsed from string, from python, while a .py not only gets precompiled, but also parsed by python itself.
# after all it's meant to run stuff that are already too heavy for one machine.
# if you need different config copy the client+config+utils+worker files elsewhere. it's very small.

# times are in seconds
DEBUG = True

# this is the time between polling the workers for a free slot. 2 is the minimum, lower than that could choke the workers
COOLDOWN = 2
# the time to sleep after a task is done. useful for helping with network delays. will add time to each process, so it will make everything slower.
SLEEP = 0
WORKERS = (
	# you can use an ip or "localhost" this is intentional. but "localhost" is preferred, since that will force you to set up ssh tunneling
	# which has security implications
	# the order defines the priority. workers are always tested in order. (that's absolutely intentional).

# List of commands to run directly, * means all.
